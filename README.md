### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, the whole project was a favorite because of the nostalgia. Where we started
    as programmers coding mere stentences where now it is a lot mroe complicated. 
    HelloWorld is a program that all programmers have done and this was the place we 
    joined the family of programs.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite because I never knew how the game of BlackJack 
    worked. Learning it and implementing into code was one of my favourite exprience. 
    BlackJack is a cool game and many people play on software that us programmers make.


* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was one of my favourte labs because it thought me a lot in the 
    sense that coders are very involved in images and colors. When using software 
    programmers are involved in image and colores. Detecing certain thing on
    images and colors is very fasanating.
